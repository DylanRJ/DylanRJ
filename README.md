I am an aspiring and driven full-stack developer who likes to build beautiful user experiences and solid, maintainable code for the long-term with the best technologies available. After rethinking my career direction, I decided to apply for the [Makers Academy] software development course and was accepted on a fully-funded place.

I am looking to join a team where I can bring my design experience, developing my skills and knowledge of programming. I am keen to join a team with a positive and supportive environment, where professional programming principles are followed and individual and team growth is encouraged.

### Professional skills

#### Communication
Exceptional written and verbal communication skills; understanding and responding to colleague and client goals and requests has been integral part of my professional experience. Having worked in consultancy and also with end-users I’ve learnt how to be an effective communicator and translate complex topics into simple concepts, working with technical and non-technical colleagues to foster understanding of systems and products. As part of the Makers Acadmey course I was regularly working in agile sprints of pair programming which allowed me to practice technical and compassionate communication with fellow developers.

#### Problem Solving
Proven track record of combining different skillsets to solve problems. In my last role with the Nuffield Foundation, after conducting my initial review of the  CRM environment that the organisation had recently implemented, it became clear that there was an issue with the data architecture of the environment. This was leading to confusing data presentation and a gradual snowballing effect of bad data management. I submitted my review which recommended changing some of the relationships in the  architecture.
At this time a financial system (FinancialForce) was chosen to integrate with the CRM system and the consultants were conducting early scoping. The consultants looking at our environment recommended the same changes in order for their financial package to best integrate with the system.
During the Makers Academy course, I was consistently required to use problem solving skills in order to find solutions to fundamental feature problems within projects and isolated unit problems within exercises. Using testing frameworks and stack trace dissection to become a competent debugger.

#### Adaptability
During earlier employment experience, my responsibilities varied between understanding and creating solutions to technical challenges from colleagues, being front-facing to clients and effectively working with third-party consultants. In my role with London & Partners I was hired as a contractor to finalise a SSO feature between two separate digital platforms that involved constant communication with a third-party consultant. I was also involved in working with internal stakeholders to wrap up the community portal for their external partners as well as also working with the organisation’s clients to understand and advise on and integration between Eventbrite accounts and the Salesforce Campaigns object. My experience with varied responsibilities in professional roles then aided me with wearing many hats within a project team on the Makers Academy course. Ensuring that the test suite for our final project was to a satisfactory coverage level and then switching out with developers struggling to finalise the visual display of our webapp using Bootstrap CSS gave me real experience in being adaptable outside of a platform-oriented professional role.
