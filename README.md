I am an aspiring and driven full-stack developer who likes to build beautiful user experiences and solid, maintainable code for the long-term with the best technologies available. After rethinking my career direction, I decided to apply for the [Makers Academy] software development course and was accepted on a fully-funded place.

I am looking to join a team where I can bring my design experience, developing my skills and knowledge of programming. I am keen to join a team with a positive and supportive environment, where professional programming principles are followed and individual and team growth is encouraged.

### Professional skills

#### Communication
Exceptional written and verbal communication skills; understanding and responding to colleague and client goals and requests has been essential part of my professional experience. Having worked in consultancy and also with end-users Iâ€™ve learned how to be an effective communicator and translate complex topics into simple concepts, working with technical and non-technical colleagues in order to foster understanding of systems and products. As part of the Makers Acadmey course  I was regularly working in agile sprints of pair programming which allowed me to practice technical and compassionate communication with fellow developers.

#### Problem Solving
Proven track record of combining different skillsets to solve problems. In my last role with the Nuffield Foundation, after conducting my initial review of the Salesforce CRM system that the organisation had recently implemented, it became clear that there was an issue with the data architecture of the environment. This was leading to confusing data presentation and a gradual snowballing effect of bad data management.
I submitted my review which recommended changing some of the relationships in the data architecture in order to better represent those real-world relationships for the users of the environment who were becoming dismayed at the system. Followed by a data migration and cleansing exercise to refit the data into the new structure.
It so happened that at the same time a financial system (FinancialForce) was chosen to integrate with the Salesforce CRM system and the consultants were conducting early scoping processes. The consultants looking at our Salesforce environment recommended that the same changes that I had recommended previously be enacted in order for their financial package to best integrate with the system.
This represents a few of the problem solving abilities I displayed during my time in employment. During the Makers Academy course, I was consistently required to use problem solving skills in order to find solutions to fundamental feature problems within projects and isolated unit problems within exercises. Using testing frameworks and stack trace disection to become a competent debugger.

#### Adaptability
During earlier employment experience my responsibilities varied between understanding and creating solutions to technical challenges, being front-facing to clients and partners and mentoring less experienced colleagues. In my role with London & Partners I was hired as a contractor to finalise a SSO between two separate digital platforms that involved constant communciation with an third-party consultant, at the same time I was involved in working with internal stakeholders to wrap up the community portal for their external partners and I was also working with the oragnisation's clients to understand and advise on and integration between Eventbrite accounts and the Salesforce Campaigns object. Wearing many hats within professional roles then aided me in taking up multiple responsilities within a project team on the Makers Acadmey course, ensuring that the test suite for our final project was to a satisfactory level of coverage and then switching out with developers struggling to finalise the visual display of our webapp using Bootstrap CSS gave me real experience in being adaptable outside of a platform-oriented role.
