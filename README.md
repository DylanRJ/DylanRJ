I am an aspiring and driven full-stack developer who likes to build beautiful user experiences and solid, maintainable code for the long-term with the best technologies available. After rethinking my career direction, I decided to apply for the [Makers Academy] software development course and was accepted on a fully-funded place.

I am looking to join a team where I can bring my design experience, developing my skills and knowledge of programming. I am keen to join a team with a positive and supportive environment, where professional programming principles are followed and individual and team growth is encouraged.
